patch 0.0:

- Clicking on a tile defines it's colour (green or red) based on wether or not there is a bomb in it;
- After looking for a bomb on the first tile, we apply the same test to the 8 tiles around it, and thus, we change their colour too.

patch 0.1:

- If the tile has a bomb, we don't test the tiles around it;
- If the tile has already changed color, we don't test the tiles around it.

patch 0.2:

- Added a function to replace the tile tests;
  (beforehand, there only was ifs based on the placement, now there is a loop)
- The test only applies to the adjacent tiles now.

patch 0.3:

- The test now verifies if the tiles are off-bound, if so, we don't count them in.

patch 0.4:

- Probability of finding a bomb decreased by 50%;
- The activebackground is now also changed when the test is complete;
- Added a function that displays the number of bombs on each tiles around the one clicked when it is above 0.

patch 0.8:

- The size of the text displaying the number of bombs on the tile is now bigger;
- The bomb counting function has been fixed;
- The test now applies again to 8 tiles instead of the 4 adjactent ones;
- coordonates bug patched;
- tiles testing and discovering patched;

- Graphic style updated (coulours and text);

patch beta 2.0:

- tiles test and bomb counting on the tiles that are on the higher and lower border have been fixed;
  (beforehand, only the tiles that were left to the tile clicked on where tested)
- added recursive tiles test: if one of the tiles found doesn't have bombs around we do the test again on it;
- patched a bug that didn't let the losing scenario take place correctly.

patch beta 3.5:

- added a replay button when winning or losing a game;
